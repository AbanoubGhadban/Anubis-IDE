# Objective
- We created Anubis IDE as a task in our Graduation Project in Faculty of Engineering Ain-Shams Univeristy to help us edit and compile Micropython Codes .
- We added some features on it like upload our code on **esp32**. **(this is feature is hidden)** 
- We developed Anubis IDE using PYQT5 .
- PyQt is a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.

## Requirements 
- Python
- Pyserial (**Important for detecting ports section**)
- PYQT5
## Setup

## Run
- First be sure you exist in the repo folder after cloning .
